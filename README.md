## Image Filters using Python
A Python project that uses machine learning, specifically the k-means algorithm, to filter images reducing it down to a few core colors.

#### To dupulicate and/or interact with this project:
Run this command in your terminal:

```
Import the folder into your respected IDE and run the main.py file. 

## General Technical Description
This project relies on certain image formatting and the k-means machine learning algorithm. I used the plain (P3) PPM raster image format to represent inputted images and a tuple of three integers from 0 to 255 (Red, Green, Blue) to represent the colors/pixels of an inputted image. The k-means algorithm begins with randomly generated colors that represent the centers of clusters of colors (completely random colors with no relation to the inputted image). Then it takes each pixel in the image and assigns it to the most similar color cluster. After that's done, the algorithm will average out the pixels in each color cluster and set that averaged color as the new color to represent the center of the color cluster. The algorithm repeats itself until it finds a combination of color clusters that cannot be improved. Finally, after the algorithm's obtained the most accurate clusters of colors, it will take each pixel in the original image, find the closest color cluster, and set the center color of that color cluster to the pixel in a new image. This new image will be outputted with only the center colors in the color clusters.

## What I Learned
I learned the k-means machine learning algorithm: how to design it, when to implement it, and what it does. I also learned how to represent images in certain formats using different types of data representations. Finally, I became very familiar with some of Python's data structures and useful functions.
